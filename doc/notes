*********************** RESUME HERE ***********************
// I think I have to go polymorphic on these things.

user :has_many policies, :through => :positions
user :has_many issues, through => :monitor

policy :belongs_to  user
policy :belongs_to issue

issue :has_many policies
issue :has_many users, :through => :monitors
	via the Monitoring functionality; the issue gets added to the monitoring user's list of issues
		rename concern => issue, add a Monitors table {id, user_id, issue_id}

:user has_many :votes, :polymorphic => true
Agree/Disagree => Opinions
Monitor/Dismiss => Priorities

(vote with your feet/clicks)

user

issue
	accepts_nested_resources_for :user
|
policy
	accepts_nested_resources_for [:issue, :user]


this way creating a policy will also create an issue and a user
	then can go back in and try and merge them appropriately
		i.e. if the user signs in/up, associate the policies/issues they've made to the new user_id 


user
	has_many :issues
	has_many :policies, :through => :issue

issue
	belongs_to :user
	has_many :policies

policy
	belongs_to :issue
	belongs_to :user, :through => :issue
